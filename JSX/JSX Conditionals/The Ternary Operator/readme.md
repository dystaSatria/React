# Ternary Operator Documentation

There’s a more compact way to write conditionals in JSX: the ternary operator.

The ternary operator works the same way in React as it does in regular JavaScript. However, it shows up in React surprisingly often.

Recall how it works: you write x ? y : z, where x, y, and z are all JavaScript expressions. When your code is executed, x is evaluated as either “truthy” or “falsy”. If x is truthy, then the entire ternary operator returns y. If x is falsy, then the entire ternary operator returns z.

Here’s how you might use the ternary operator in a JSX expression:

```jsx
const headline = (
  <h1>
    { age >= drinkingAge ? 'Buy Drink' : 'Do Teen Stuff' }
  </h1>
);
```

In the above example, if age is greater than or equal to drinkingAge, then headline will equal ``` <h1>Buy Drink</h1>```. Otherwise, headline will equal ``` <h1>Do Teen Stuff</h1>```.
